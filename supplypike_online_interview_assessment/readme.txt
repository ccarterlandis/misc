TruckStatsFinder is an class designed to take in an array of tuples which the represent the starting and ending dates for truck service for varying trucks. It then compute the years with the absolute minimum and maximum number of trucks of service, as well as a configurable number of years with minimum and maximum trucks in service, i.e. the 5 years with the most active trucks. 

I chose to approach this using a dictionary. I read in the array of ranges, and for every year in-between the two range dates, I incremented the value of a dictionary with the key corresponding to that year, i.e. if a truck was active between 1900 and 1905, then the values at keys 1900, 1901, 1902, 1903, 1904, and 1905 would all be incremented (to show duration of active service). In my implementation, however, when checking the ranges, it checks EVERY number in the list every time it is counting a truckâ€™s years of active service - I was unable to find time to refactor, but had I more time, that is definitely what I would tackle first, as that runs in O(n) time and it could definitely be faster.
